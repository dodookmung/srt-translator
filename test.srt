1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
I couldn't respond, there was no Wi-Fi on this plane.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,180
Then why were you online?

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,420
Oh, the pilot has Wi-Fi.

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:04,740
What?

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,920
Dude, what are you doing?

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,000
Yo, close the door.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,080
You've been missing for two months.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,820
What are you, detoxing from social media?

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,780
Detoxing from society.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,460
I didn't know you were living in a hostel.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,120
It's not a hostel, it's a data center.

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,720
What?

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:26,940
What?

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,520
Don't you want to tape off the camera for safety reasons?

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,520
Yo, it's Linux, the camera doesn't work.

16
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,380
Dude, our platform is now deployable everywhere.

17
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,780
Google Cloud, AWS.

18
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,360
Azure?

19
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,060
What is Azure?

20
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,820
Is it cross-border?

21
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,260
Yeah, you know, Netscape, second tier browsers, like Chrome.

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,280
You saw the new engineer role applications?

23
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,000
It's just resumes with anime pictures.

24
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,640
Dude, I'm telling you, if you want to advertise a product, you just got to put it in an anime.

25
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,000
That is the stupidest thing I've heard.

26
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,180
Why is there a cockroach in here?

27
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,220
Oh, dude, that's...

28
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,200
Yo, we can just test our release on this EEG.

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,640
No!

30
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,700
Just, we're going to take over people's consciousness.

31
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,180
And we're using Java for that.

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,500
It kind of sucks.

33
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,360
Let me rewrite that.

34
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:01,740
Rust.

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,820
No, no.

36
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,320
Yo, we can use lifetimes and borrow checkers.

37
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,700
No, no, no.

38
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,220
Mutex.

39
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,940
The speed, it's not O of N.

40
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,540
What is it?

41
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,220
It's assembly.

42
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,600
Am I learning from the AI?

43
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,140
Is the AI really learning from me?

44
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,720
They should be paying me per token.

45
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,260
Have you seen the videos of the drone warfares?

46
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,420
Yeah, Nixer is the best for every use case.

47
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,200
It's generating.

48
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,420
This is what I live for.

49
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,680
Are you giving yourself more bucks to fix than you need?

50
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,240
The buck isn't in my code.

51
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,960
It's in the Intel architecture.

52
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,280
What?

53
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,180
What's the graphic card?

54
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,320
It's for generating my prompts.

55
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,980
You know CUDA?

56
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,500
No, the AMD equivalent.

57
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,820
We built the feature, but we also make the database a list of chained lists.

58
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,900
Why do you want that?

59
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,820
Well, otherwise it would be too simple.

60
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,880
You're making it harder than it needs to be.

61
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,100
I get paid for solving hard problems.

62
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,100
My Vim is better than their Vim.

63
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,440
Cross-compiled it from punch card.

64
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,780
Quantum computing.

65
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,400
I hope we fix relational databases, first of all.

66
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,700
What's our production debug suit?

67
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,300
Jammer.

68
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,580
What's our development debug suit?

69
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,420
Hello?

70
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,220
A debug in production.

71
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,540
No!

72
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,500
We're going to get problems in this lower tier exploit.

73
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,020
In the market.

74
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,060
Dude, I know.

75
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,180
I wrote that virus.

76
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,820
Are you joking?

77
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,060
Not lower tier.

78
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,620
I put a lot of effort into this.

79
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,220
Wait, what?

80
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,560
Cross-compiled it from punch card.

81
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,860
What?

82
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,280
Oh my...

83
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,100
Tell me we didn't cross an ethical bridge and we're not going to get sued.

84
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,520
We didn't cross an ethical bridge.

85
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,180
What about the second part?

86
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
What about the second part?

87
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,140
I said I'm going to finish it in December and I am finishing it in December.

88
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,200
It's already January.

89
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,820
What?

90
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:28,880
What?

91
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,540
I was in for the whole week.

92
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,460
What day is it?

93
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,300
It's Friday.

94
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,820
What week?

95
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,140
Friday in December?

96
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,460
Dude, are you joking?

97
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,020
Did you even celebrate New Year's?

98
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,700
What year?

99
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,600
When did you enter the room?

100
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,380
What day is it?

101
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Oh my God.

102
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,540
You don't even have a kitchen in here.

103
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,380
What have you been cooking?

104
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,980
AGI.

105
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,600
What?

106
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,280
The microwave that was as a network station.

107
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,660
What's with your backspace key?

108
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,060
Don't worry, I don't make mistakes.

109
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,080
Don't come too close.

110
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,800
I have 47 raspberry pies in a washing saloon downstairs.

111
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,780
Dude, you need to get out of this.

112
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,640
You need sunlight, dude.

113
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,360
No, no, no.

114
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
Close the blinds or we'll mess up my sleep schedule.

115
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
You need some sunlight.

116
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,360
It's going to burn my house, I'm going to get a sunburn.

117
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,620
What are you, a vampire?

118
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Dude, what are you doing?

119
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,320
Dude, you're like a bat.

120
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,700
No, there is no bats in here.

121
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
I'm busy.

122
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,360
What are you busy with, dude?

123
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,980
Dude, it starts with A and ends with GI.

124
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,820
I don't have to tell you.

125
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,360
Oh my God.

126
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,440
You need some air, man.

127
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,880
I have air conditioning.

128
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,560
It's the best air.

129
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,560
We're capturing this like...

130
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,700
Oh my God, dude.

131
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,440
Are you done?

132
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,860
Yeah, I mean, I'm just like worried about you, man.

133
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,920
Don't worry about me, worry about the world.

134
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,200
Fix the cockroach.

135
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,440
Fix the cockroach in your room first and then fix AGI.

136
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,120
We don't have time for both.

137
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,240
Leave the shoes, man.

138
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,500
You haven't left for months.

139
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,960
What are you going to need the shoes for?

140
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm going to have to learn CUDA.

141
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:39,960
Why?

142
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,080
It's complex like...

143
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,200
Thermodynamics, man.

144
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,180
Thermodynamics?

145
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,180
Pre-training, as we know it, is gone.

146
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,760
Have you not read like the latest Eurips papers?

147
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,340
What? No, dude, I'm making TikToks for the company.

148
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm up.

149
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
That's right, I forgot.

150
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,600
Dude, you got to stop going on 4chan, man.

151
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,980
We're going to face scrutiny.

152
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,060
Did you look through the files on my computer through Trojan?

153
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
No, I didn't.

154
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,600
What?

155
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,860
You're doing the wrong thing,

156
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,520
but I want you to learn from your mistake.

157
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,100
What? No, it's not okay.

158
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,600
I don't want to learn from any mistake.

159
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,320
It's for your own safety.

160
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,020
Oh, my God.

161
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,900
I also installed Arch Linux on it, but...

162
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,240
What?

163
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,620
I get pop-ups every time somebody tries to break my firewall.

164
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,360
Never had pop-ups in a year.

165
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,200
What are they afraid of?

166
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,780
What are you even up to?

167
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,200
Why are you filming my computer, man?

168
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
It's proprietary stuff.

169
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,960
Oh, I'll make sure the CIA sees it.

170
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,080
I'll make sure everyone sees it.

171
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,500
No way.

172
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,760
Yeah, I hope they all see it.

173
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
I hope they see your face too, huh?

174
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,560
That's fine, man.

175
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,420
I've been monitoring for the past 12 years.

176
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm sure the FBI is thinking about you a lot.

177
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
Oh, I know where the FBI is.

178
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,100
I'm sure you're on their most wanted list.

179
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,220
I know. They're on my most wanted list too.

180
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,100
Man, you're going to get yourself in trouble staying in here.

181
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,020
You should be leaving, man.

182
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,440
Yeah, I better get out soon before I get arrested.

183
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,320
You won't get arrested.

184
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,820
I saw your record. You're good.

185
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,320
What?

186
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
I don't have time, man.

187
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,320
I'm focusing.

188
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,460
Dude, you need to get out of this.

189
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,240
This is ridiculous, dude.

190
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,780
Can I text you something?

191
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,100
Text you?

192
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,300
Well, is I receive running on your food phone?
